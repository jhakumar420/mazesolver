The micromouse project employs N 20 motors, Arduino Mega microcontroller, and L298N motor driver for control. The N 20 motors provide compact and efficient motion, ideal for small-scale robotic applications like the micromouse. The Arduino Mega serves as the central processing unit, executing programmed algorithms for navigation, obstacle detection, and motor control. The L298N motor driver facilitates the interface between the Arduino Mega and the N 20 motors, managing motor speed and direction based on the signals received from the microcontroller. This setup enables precise and agile movement, essential for navigating maze environments characteristic of micromouse competitions.
